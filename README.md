# Domain Generalization for Robust Diabetic Retinopathy Classification
Domain Generalization for Robust Diabetic Retinopathy Classification is a thesis project for M.Sc. Intelligent Adaptive Systems.

In this thesis, it has been suggested to apply domain adversarial training, an unsupervised, multi-source, multi-target domain generalization model that has been proven to perform robust diabetic retinopathy classification.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Code description

- Dataset.py: this file allows to separate the images from EyePACS dataset by their corresponding camera labels.
- Functions.py: contains different functions that will make easier perform different actions of the project. 
- Preprocessing_dataset.ipynb: Write the folder that contains the images from which we want to remove the masks and resize to 512x512, and then write the folder that we want to move the images into.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
